This script should technically compile a version of the kernel that allows custom modules to be loaded into wsl2

It automatically places the bzImage at the right location and should automatically fill the .wslconfig by itself (it seems to be broken)


To be added later:

- If failing stop script


Instructions:

- make script executable (chmod +x wsl-kernel-module.sh)
- (maybe execute the apt commands manually)
- execute script
- wsl will be shutdown, just restart it by opening terminal session and it should load in automatically
